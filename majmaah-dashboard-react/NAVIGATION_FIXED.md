# ✅ NAVIGATION UPDATED TO MATCH YOUR SCREENSHOT EXACTLY!

## 🔄 What I Just Fixed:

### ✅ **Sidebar Navigation (Now Correct)**
Based on your screenshot, the navigation for ADVANCEDCLIENT now shows:

1. **Dashboard** (with teal active state)
2. **Content Management** (group)
   - Planting Records Certificates
   - Departments
   - Employees
   - Planting Record Assignments
   - Certifications History
3. **Company Certificate** (group)
   - Trees Certificate
   - Basic Certificate

**Removed:** All the extra items (Projects, Programs, Regions, Species Libraries, Services, Sliders, About Us, Contacts, Newsletters, Users)

### ✅ **Topbar (Now Correct)**
Added from your screenshot:
- **EN** language switcher (top right)
- **Bell icon** for notifications (with red dot)
- **User initials** in dark circle (MU)
- Proper spacing and styling

### ✅ **Dashboard Header (Now Correct)**
- Just "Dashboard" title (no Majmaah logo)
- "Generate detailed report" button on right
- Clean, simple layout
